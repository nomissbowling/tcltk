OVERVIEW:

Pgtcl is the Tcl interface for the PostgreSQL Database Management System.
It is a loadable Tcl module implementing commands which allow an
application to interact with a PostgreSQL database. Pgtcl-ng is the "next
generation" implementation of Pgtcl.

This is a binary release for Windows. Provided your system meets the
requirements below, you can use this without compiling or building.

This release uses the Tcl "stubs" mechanism, which should allow it to be
used with any version of Tcl 8.x. It was built with Tcl 8.5.15, and tested
with ActiveState ActiveTcl 8.6.1 and 8.5.15. See REQUIREMENTS below.

This release includes only the MinGW built version of libpgtcl.dll.
To use the MinGW build, you need EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL from
(www.enterprisedb.com). You can use their free Windows build of PostgreSQL.

This release was built with the PostgreSQL-9.3.4 run-time client system,
and was was tested on Windows XP SP3, connecting to PostgreSQL-9.3.5 and
PostgreSQL-9.2.9 servers running on Linux.

The source release and full documentation for pgtcl-ng are available at the
site listed in the header of this file. Even though you may freely use
and redistribute this binary release in accordance with the open-source
license in COPYING, we suggest you also download the source release - just
because you can.


REQUIREMENTS:

 +  ActiveState ActiveTcl 8.6.1 or 8.5.15 (see http://www.activestate.com )
       These are the tested versions. Other patch levels of 8.4.x, 8.5.x,
       and 8.6.x should work.
       NOTE: The Pgtcl-ng binary release for Windows uses the
       Tcl "stubs" mechanism which provides independence from specific
       versions of Tcl. The same release of Pgtcl-ng should work with all
       Tcl-8.6, 8.5, and 8.4 versions, and perhaps older versions too.

 +  A PostgreSQL database server somewhere on your network.  This has been
       tested with PostgreSQL-9.3.5 and PostgreSQL-9.2.9 servers.
       It should also work with older versions.

 +  To use the MinGW-built pgtclng, you need the EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL
       installation on the client side, or at least the DLL files from the
       "bin" directory. The MinGW build uses multiple PostgreSQL DLLs which
       are not included in the release.

 + EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL requires a version of the Microsoft Visual C++
       Redistributable libraries. This includes "msvcr*.dll". If you
       use the EnterpriseDB Installer, it will install this (if necessary).
       If you do not use the installer, you need to make sure the correct
       version of the Visual C++ libraries is installed. These are
       downloadable from Microsoft.

KNOWN BUGS and LIMITATIONS - Windows Release:

+ This release was built for 32-bit Windows systems, and tested only
  on 32-bit Windows.

+ Changes to the connection control environment variables (such as PGHOST,
  PGDATABASE) are not seen once the DLL is loaded. This is either a Windows
  DLL environment variable issue, a Tcl environment variable issue, or both.
  This should not be a problem, since environment variables are mostly for
  setting outside your application.

+ Only TCP/IP is supported, not Unix Domain Sockets. So a hostname (or IP
  address) must be provided when connecting. If you are trying to connect
  to a PostgreSQL server running on your Windows PC, you need to specify
  host=localhost or host=127.0.0.1 to connect to it.


RELEASE ISSUES:

+ Refer to the NEWS file which can be found in the source release and on
  the pgtclng web site for important changes and compatibility issues in
  this release and previous releases.


INSTALLATION and USAGE:

Refer to the reference manual for more details. Here is a quick summary
of the two most common ways to install and use this release:

You must have the EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL installation on the client PC
(or at least the "bin" directory), and its "bin" directory must be on your
PATH. This is necessary so the multiple dependent DLLs can be found.

Option 1) Package Require

 (a) Create a new directory "Pgtcl2.1" under the Tcl library directory.
     For example, this might be: "c:\Program Files\Active Tcl\tcl8.5\lib".
     Note: you can use the 3-part version if you prefer: "Pgtcl2.1.1".

 (b) Copy the files: libpgtcl.dll and pkgIndex.tcl into that directory.

 (c) You application uses: "package require Pgtcl"

Option 2) Direct Loading:

 (a) Copy libpgtcl.dll into any directory where it is convenient for
     your application, or into a directory on your PATH, or into the Tcl
     "bin" directory.

 (b) Your application uses:  "load .../libpgtcl.dll"
     where ".../" is a path prefix which you need to supply if libpgtcl is
     not installed on PATH or in the Tcl "bin" directory.
