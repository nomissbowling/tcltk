  <title>Preface</title>
  <para>
This book documents <application>Pgtcl</application>, a Tcl package for
client programs to interface with PostgreSQL
database servers.  It makes most of the functionality of
<application>libpq</application> available to Tcl scripts.
  </para>
  <para>
This manual describes the implementation of <application>Pgtcl</application>
called <application>pgtcl-ng</application> ("next generation").
<application>pgtcl-ng</application> implements the interface as a loadable
library called <filename>libpgtcl</filename>,
which can be directly loaded into a Tcl interpreter or via the Tcl package
mechanism.
This implementation is available at
<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgtclng/">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgtclng/</ulink>
<footnote>
  <para>
Until March 2011, the pgtcl-ng project was hosted at 
http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pgtclng/
  </para>
</footnote>.
<application>Pgtcl-ng</application> implements all of the commands and
functions described in this manual.
The current version of pgtcl-ng is 2.1.1.
Notations in this manual indicate features added to
<application>pgtcl-ng</application> after version 1.5.0.
  </para>
  <para>
Another implementation of <application>Pgtcl</application> is the
pure-Tcl version called <application>pgintcl</application>.
<application>pgintcl</application> implements the interface as a script
file <filename>pgin.tcl</filename> which can be sourced into a Tcl
interpreter or loaded via the Tcl package mechanism.
<application>Pgintcl</application> supports most of the commands and
functions described in this manual. It does not support
asynchronous query processing commands in <xref linkend="pgtcl-ref-async" />
nor the <xref linkend="pg-on-connection-loss" /> function.
Also, <application>Pgintcl</application> implements bulk COPY differently,
so the examples in <xref linkend="pgtcl-example-copy" /> do not apply.
Since it is written entirely in Tcl, <application>pgintcl</application>
can be significantly slower than <application>pgtcl-ng</application>,
but can be used on any platform where Tcl is available, without compilation.
<application>Pgintcl</application> is available at
<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgintcl/">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgintcl/</ulink>
<footnote>
  <para>
Until March 2011, the pgintcl project was hosted at
http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pgintcl/
  </para>
</footnote>.
The current version of pgintcl is 3.5.0.
Notations in this manual indicate features added to
<application>pgintcl</application> after version 2.0.0.
  </para>
  <para>
There are two other implementations of <application>Pgtcl</application>.
The version bundled with <application>PostgreSQL</application> through
version 7.4.x provided a compatible subset of the commands and functions
documented in this manual, but is now obsolete.
The project hosted at
<ulink url="http://flightaware.github.com/Pgtcl/">
http://flightaware.github.com/Pgtcl/</ulink>
provides many of the same commands and functions as documented in this
manual, but there are extensions and incompatibilities. Consult the respective
documentation for these implementations for more information.
