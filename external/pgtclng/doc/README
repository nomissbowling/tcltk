pgtcl/doc/README: Pgtcl Reference Manual Source
Last updated: 2010-07-14
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the DocBook XML source files for the Pgtcl Reference
Manual, which covers pgtclng and pgintcl.

You will need the DocBook DTD, DocBook XML Stylesheets, and an XSL
Transformation Processor program such as xsltproc in order to build
the manual.

I am using the following:
   DocBook DTD V4.5 from http://www.docbook.org/xml/4.4/
   DocBook-XSL-1.75.1 Stylesheets from http://docbook.sourceforge.net/
   xsltproc from libxslt-1.1.24
Other versions should also work, more or less. If you use a different version
of the DocBook DTD, you may have to edit the DOCTYPE declaration in pgtcl.xml
and INSTALL.xml. If you don't have a working XML catalog system that can locally
resolve the XSL Stylesheets location, you must edit the URIs in manual.xsl
and install.xsl .

To build the manual HTML files from source:
  $ make
To build the stand-alone INSTALL file requires the above plus lynx.
  $ make INSTALL

To install the manual after building it, copy *.html and *.css into a
directory convenient for your web browser. The CSS file is the stylesheet
used by the manual. You can also use "make release" to package up the HTML
and CSS files into a Zip file.

Notes on manual production:

The actual manual output is XHTML, not HTML.

This manual was originally written in DocBook SGML, and later converted to
XML. Here are some of the issues I ran into when converting the manual sources.

+ Had to remove all uses of <productname>. Unlike DocBook-SGML, DocBook-XML
  always puts a registered trademark symbol after the productname markup. I
  consider this a bug, since <productname class="trademark"> is documented
  for that purpose.

+ I have never had success making quality PDF files from DocBook-XML.
