<!--
  This is used to generate INSTALL for the Pgtcl release.
  The main source is in building.xml - see the Makefile.
  The building.xml source file has special conditional markup which
  handles the difference between stand-alone INSTALL or part of the
  manual. The actual selection is done in the Makefile with a parameter.
  Conditionals standalone-ignore and standalone-include are used
  to select parts of the building.sgml file which apply only when
  in the whole manual. This is copied from the PostgreSQL manual.
