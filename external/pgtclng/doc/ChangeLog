    used to make a special copy of the manual for the project web site.

    Also: removed obsolete targets and macros.

* 2011-03-26
  Reference manual version: 20110326

  Reference manual version: 20110321 - for pgtclng-1.9.0 and pgin.tcl-3.3.0
  Copyright years extended.
  + Reference:
    Document new pg_result -dict option.
  + Examples:
    Add pg_result -dict example output.
    Add note explaining that some pg_result options don't work well when a
    query has duplicate column names, because they use column names as keys
    or indexes.

    Document Windows requirement for MS Visual C++ Redistributables if not
    using the EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL Installer.

* 2010-07-14
  Reference manual version: 20100714
  + Building and Installing on Windows:
    Fixes to new section on building on Windows with MinGW. Document the
    need for the whole EnterpriseDB "bin" directory at runtime, because there
    are more dependencies than just libpq.dll.

  + Loading pgtcl:
    Update for loading MinGW-built version of the interface.

* 2010-06-05
  Reference manual version: 20100605
  Copyright years extended.

  + Building:
    New section for building on Windows with MinGW. Changes to BCC building
    section to distinguish it from the new text. (Note: The MinGW makefile
    will be in the next source release.)
    Fixed link references so the URL text is visible when plain-text INSTALL
    is generated.

* 2009-11-25

  + Building and Installing on Windows:
    Document building stubs-enabled version for Windows. As of Pgtclng-1.7.1
    this is the default, but leave instructions in for non stubs enabled
    building also.

* 2009-09-24

  Manual generation with new toolset. Updated README to reflect versions. No
  visible changes to the manual.

  To fix the unwanted word "Abstract", just need to use empty titles. Applied
  this to all abstracts in the document, and removed the display:none hack from
  the CSS style sheet.


* 2009-09-11

  Minor final changes before release with pgtclng-1.7.0
  Reference manual version: 20090911

* 2009-09-09

  + Overview, Reference:
    Document two new commands: pg_describe_cursor and pg_describe_prepared.
    Document new options -numParams and -paramTypes to pg_result.

* 2009-09-05

  + legalinfo:
    Clarify copyright/legal notice. The material originally started as a
    product of the PostgreSQL Global Development Group, but they no longer
    contribute and are not responsible for any of the content after 2004.

  + Overview, Reference:
    Document two new commands: pg_encrypt_password and pg_lo_truncate.
    Document new optional $conn argument to pg_escape_string, pg_quote, and
      pg_escape_bytea.

  + Building: Update recommended versions.

* 2007-12-27

  + Building: Updated build instructions for Windows with ActiveState
              ActiveTcl 8.5.0. For pgtclng-1.6.2.

* 2007-01-15

  Final changes before release with pgtclng-1.6.0:

  + Overall:
    Copyright years extended to 2007.
    Changed "pgtcl" to "pgtcl-ng" in more places to avoid confusion.

  + Building:
    Patches for Windows BCC builds are removed from the manual. Separate
      per-version patch files will be released with the source release of
      pgtcl-ng. (Because of length of patches for PostgreSQL-8.2.0.)
    Don't add -c to BCC link flags. Doesn't seem to be needed.

  + Loading:
    Add a mention of 'rpath' in the library.
    Referenced version change to 1.6.0

  + Reference:
    A few commands were missing a note naming the libpq function they use
      or emulate, and these have now been added.
    Use a DocBook trick to get a Table of Contents in the Reference sections,
    but not in the rest of the manual sections.

  + Examples:
    Add a new example for pg_result_callback: event-driven results.

* 2006-12-24

  Corrections, and updating the manual for pgtclng-1.6.0:

  + XSL Style sheet:
    Fix optional parameter notation to use the Tcl conventions ?...? rather
      than the usual convention [...] (which has a different meaning in Tcl).
      This was in older versions of the manual, but was lost during the
      conversion to DocBook-XML, and has now been restored.

  + Overview:
    Use consistent wording for "executing SQL commands on the server".
    Add table entries for 3 new commands (see next item).

  + Reference:
    Document new command: pg_result_callback
    Document new command: pg_sendquery_params
    Document new command: pg_sendquery_prepared
    Document new feature: optional parameters for pg_sendquery
    Add note about the optional parameter notation "?...?".
    Same changes as in Overview for consistent wording of query execution.
    Refer to optional parameter arguments as 'param' not the generic 'arg'.
    Fix: In pg_exec_params and pg_exec_prepared, parameter arguments are
      optional. (Although it doesn't make much sense to use them without
      parameters.)
    Remove caution notes stating that the asynchronous commands and
      prepared/parameterized commands are experimental.
    Add cautions on pg_exec_prepared and pg_escape_string regarding
      incompatibility with "original Pgtcl".
    Add note to pg_exec_param pointing to use of pg_exec instead if all
      parameters and return value are TEXT type.

* 2006-12-08
  Fix: Missing pg_quote from table 1-1 command listing.

* 2006-09-09 Released reference manual dated 20060909 on pgfoundry

  This is a conversion of the manual source from DocBook-SGML to
    DocBook-XML. There are numerous small style changes as a result,
    but the content is basically the same.

* 2006-05-29 Released reference manual version 20060529 on gborg

  This is a minor update to the Pgtcl Reference Manual with corrections
    to building under Windows with PostgreSQL-8.1.x.

* 2004-11-11 Released reference manual version 20041108 on gborg

  This is the updated Pgtcl Reference Manual that goes with pgtclng-1.5.2
    and pgintcl-2.2.0.
