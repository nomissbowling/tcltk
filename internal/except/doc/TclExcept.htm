NAME</H3>
TclExcept - a Tcl-only package used to enhance robustness of Tcl code.
<H3>
<B>SYNOPSIS</B></H3>

<PRE><B>package require TclExcept ?2.0?</B></PRE>

<H3>
DESCRIPTION</H3>
<B>TclExcept</B> is a package written entirely in Tcl. Thus it is compatible
with all versions of Tcl from Tcl7.6, and on every platform. It provides
useful language constructions to ease the task of programmers willing to
write robust Tcl applications.

<P>Currently, <B>TclExcept</B> provides 2 extensions:
<UL>
<LI>
exception handling &agrave; la C++/Java</LI>

<LI>
assertions</LI>
</UL>
The exception handling subpackage provides 3 new commands: <B><A 
HREF="try.htm">try</A></B>, <B><A HREF="throw.htm">throw</A></B> and <B><A 
HREF="exception.htm">exception</A></B>. The use of these commands is similar to 
their C++/Java counterparts: <B>throw</B> is used to raise exceptional 
conditions from within a Tcl script (ie to throw exceptions), whereas <B>try</B> 
is used to catch and handle these exceptions. These commands are similar to the 
Tcl core commands <B>error</B> and <B>catch</B>, but provide a all-in-one way to 
catch AND handle exceptions. Since these commands are build on top of the 
standard Tcl error mechanism, their use is fully compatible with <B>catch</B> 
and <B>error</B>. That is, an exception thrown by a call to <B>throw</B> can be 
caught by <B>catch</B>, and a regular Tcl error generated by <B>error</B> or by 
a Tcl core command is seen as an exception by <B>try</B>. Thus, exception-aware 
Tcl code can handle regular Tcl errors, and exception-unaware
code can catch tclExcept exceptions.

<P>The assertion subpackage provides one new command: <B><A 
HREF="assert.htm">assert</A></B>.
It is used to perform a series of critical tests (eg pre- and post-conditions,
type checking or range validating, or for debugging purpose) and fails
(raising an error) if one of these tests fail. a<B>ssert</B> is exception-aware,
so it can be used efficiently with <B>try</B> (the failure of an assertion
is seen as an exception).
