I am pleased to announce the second public version of TclExcept: 

TclExcept v2.0: Tcl-only exception handling and assertion package
by Frédéric BONNET (frederic.bonnet@ciril.fr)

Updated 24 may 2000, 15h51

The home page for this package is:

************************************************************************

TclExcept is a Tcl package that provides C++ and Java-like exception handling, 
and assertions inside Tcl script. Since it is a Tcl-only extension, no 
compilation is required, and it should work with Tcl version 7.6 or newer and on 
any platform. The source file is 9kB. It has been tested on Tcl7.6, Tcl8.0.5 and 
Tcl8.2.2 on Windows95/NT and SunOS platforms.

INSTALLATION, LICENSE, ETC.

The file README.txt of the distribution contains information about the 
installation, compilation and use of TclExcept. Read it carefully. 
The file license.txt describes the license that covers TclExcept. It is very 
close to the Tcl/Tk license.

I'd appreciate that every TclExcept user send me a mail so I can keep track of 
the number of users for this software, in a purely informative goal. I won't 
make any use of these other than statistic.
Feel free to send any comment or bug report to frederic.bonnet@ciril.fr. 
TclExcept is likely to be improved depending on users feedback.
