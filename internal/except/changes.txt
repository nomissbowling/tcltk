-------- ??/??/???? TclExcept version 1.0 --------



-------- 24/05/2000 TclExcept version 2.0 --------

1. Added "exception" command and exception hierarchies

2. Modified the semantics of "finally" in try blocks: in version 1.0, the 
finally block wasn't called if control flow exception (return/break/continue) 
occurred during the try block. The logic was that the code behaved as if there 
were no exception handling in case no exception occurred. In the current 
version, the finally block is always called. This is consistent with exception 
handling in other languages (Java, Python...). Thanks to William H. Duquette for 
pointing that out.

3. Removed french documentation (maintaining both french and english was taking 
too much time).
